Q1 When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A1 A remote repository makes sense if the files will be accessed from multiple different
computers or devices. It would be useful for development teams, remote workers, and 
even accessing files from libraries and internet cafes while backpacking across Europe. 
Additionally, the remote repository provides file redundancy in the case of hardware 
failure on a local device.

Q1 When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A1 A remote repository makes sense if the files will be accessed from multiple different
computers or devices. It would be useful for development teams, remote workers, and 
even accessing files from libraries and internet cafes while backpacking across Europe. 
Additionally, the remote repository provides file redundancy in the case of hardware 
failure on a local device. 

Q2 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A2 Pulling changes manually provides more control over which branch of code I have to work
with on my local computer. If I am part of a development team, the most recent commits on 
the remote repository might be code sections, files, or branches that another member of the
team has been working on rather than the code relevent to my current development work.

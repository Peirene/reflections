Q1 What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A1 Initializing a repository creates the .git file which stores the metadata
describing the files and their status at a point in time (commit). 

Q2 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

A2 The staging area gives you a way to specify which files you want to include in
a commit. It provides an opportunity for review and revision.
